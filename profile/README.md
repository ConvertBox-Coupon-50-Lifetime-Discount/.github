## How Much Does ConvertBox Cost??

Convertbox offers **2 simple pricing** options to its users.

| **Plan** | **Price** | **What You Get** | **Billing Type** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Standard Lifetime | $495 (one-time) | 250,000 views/month, up to 10 websites | One-time payment, no renewals |
| Pro Upgrade Add-on |  | Increases to 500,000 views/month, supports 50 websites, 5 sub-users | One-time add-on |
| Pro Lifetime Bundle | $590 (one-time) | 500,000 views/month, 50 websites, 5 sub-users | Lifetime, no extra charges |
| Monthly Plan | $99/month | Usage limit not clearly shared | Monthly recurring |
| Free Trial | $0 for 14 days | Full access to all features during the trial | No payment needed |

### ConvertBox Free Trial and Tools

ConvertBox doesn‚Äôt have a regular free trial, but you can still try it without risk thanks to their **14-day money-back guarantee.**

You get complete access to all their premium features for 14 days, to help you decide if it is the right platform to solve all your lead generation needs or not.

If it‚Äôs not right for you, just ask for a refund within 14 days.

ConvertBox also offers some helpful free tools to try before you commit:

- **Free Pop-Up Strategy Guide:** Get a high-converting pop-up guide by sharing your email. This helps you plan campaigns without paying anything upfront.
- **Pre-Made A/B Test Templates:** Use ready-to-go templates in your dashboard to improve forms‚Äîno expert help needed.
- **Free Webinar Access:** Join ConvertBox‚Äôs free lead generation webinars through their newsletter and learn advanced strategies.

These tools make it easy to see what ConvertBox can do without any long-term commitment.

Just make sure you stay within usage limits if you want a refund under the 14-day policy.

## More Ways to Save on ConvertBox

Apart from those juicy coupon deals and discount offers, there are still few ways using which you can save a significant amount on your subscription.

### 1. Get the Lifetime Deal

ConvertBox offers a one-time lifetime access plan. While the upfront cost is higher, it saves you a lot more than paying **$99 every month**.

You make a single payment and enjoy the platform for life‚Äîno renewals or hidden fees.

### 2. Share the Cost with a Team

If you're part of a small agency or have trusted partners, you can split the cost. The Pro upgrade allows multiple sub-users, which makes it easy for several people to access the tool while sharing the total cost.

### 3. Look Out for Seasonal Offers

Though ConvertBox doesn‚Äôt run frequent promotions, it may offer special deals during big events like **Black Friday or the New Year**.

Signing up for their newsletter or following them online can help you catch these limited-time savings.

### 4. Avoid the Monthly Plan

Paying $99 every month adds up quickly. Instead, choosing the lifetime plan eliminates ongoing charges. Over a year, the lifetime deal can pay for itself and continue saving you money for years to come.

**Pro tip:** Combine a **Lifetime deal** with annual billing and check the newsletter for flash sales to stretch your budget.

Follow ConvertBox on X or LinkedIn for deal alerts.
